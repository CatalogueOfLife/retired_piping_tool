This update only includes supply side software v 1.1 and database schema. Distribution side is under development. However the distribution side web user interface is provided by usermin which can be downloaded and installed from http://sourceforge.net/projects/webadmin/files/webmin/1.570/webmin_1.570_all.deb/download and sits on top of GSD accounts which are ordinary Linux user accounts. Data gets distributed by a trigger in the main database into GSD MySQL databases (schema limited to single taxa table) accessible by GSD users.
