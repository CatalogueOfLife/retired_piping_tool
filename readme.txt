This update only includes supply side software v 1.1 and database schema. Distribution side is under development. However the distribution side web user interface is provided by usermin, which in turn is configured by webmin which can be downloaded and installed from http://www.webmin.com/download.html. Usermin sits on top of GSD accounts which are plain Linux user accounts. Setup instructions for webmin on Debian are provided at http://www.webmin.com/deb.html. It is worth noting that on Debian isntallation route from downloaded package using wget might be more convenient (more straight-forward to configure after setup) than the installation route using APT. 

Data gets 'piped' into GSD MySQL databases (schema limited to single taxa table) accessible by GSD users e.g. `pipe_fishbase` by a trigger sitting in the main `piping` database. Note that user of the main `piping` database must have the necessary privileges granted to modify databases of the GSDs.
